Implement your code in the `myIsdigit()` function.  The function
takes a `char` as input.  You should return a boolean result
of `true` if the character is a digit in the set
('0', '1', '2', '3', '4', '5', '6', '7', '8', '9').  If not in
this set, the funciton should return a `false` result.

You need to perform the following steps:

1. Use some form of selection control statement to determine if the `charToTest`
   is a digit or not.
2. If it is one of the 10 digit characters, return a `true` boolean result.
3. If it is not a digit, return `false`.

**Suggested Solution**


**Additional Requirements**

- You are required to implement the logic to test and return the
  true/false result by hand here.
- You are required to use an `if` or `switch` selection control
  statement.
